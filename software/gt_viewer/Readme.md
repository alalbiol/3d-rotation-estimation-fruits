# Description

This folfer contains `display_gt.py`, a simple script to visualize and validate the ground truth data. 


## Usage

Move to one of the fruits folders (mandarins in this example): 

```bash
cd (ROOT_PATH)/3d-rotation-estimation-fruits/data/mandarins
```
where `ROOT_PATH` is the folder where data has been downloaded. Now launch the display program as:
```
python ../../sofware/gt_viewer/display_gt.py
```
Now, all the annotations are shown (source and target point correspondences).
